                    <summary>About Me:</summary>
                    <p>I am a graduate student at <b>Northeastern University</b> working towards a <em>Master of Science in Information Systems</em>. I want to develop my cross-disciplinary technical and management skills in the sectors of tech consulting and software engineering.</p>
                       <p> I've always been interested by the evolving nature of technology and its potential to change lives as a passionate student. I've started this rewarding academic journey in my pursuit of excellence in software development, and I'm learning more about advanced programming ideas, software design, and current market trends. I'm building a stronger foundation in programming languages like Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as cutting-edge development frameworks and tools like React, Angular, Spring Boot, and Django through practical projects and challenging coursework.</p> 
                       <p>In addition to producing code, I have a strong commitment to writing clear documentation that future developers will find easy to understand and maintain. I get great satisfaction from overcoming challenging architectural problems and enhancing performance to produce high-performing and scalable apps. Furthermore, I actually care about the end users. My design choices are based on an understanding of customer requirements and problems, resulting in software that is simple to use and pleasurable to use.<br>
